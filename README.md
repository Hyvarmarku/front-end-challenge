## What to do

Your job is to make the angular app display all the cars and when the user clicks a car, display the car on its own page (use routing). We encourage to be as visual as you can be and do your best! This should take you about 4 hours.

### Features:
- Search cars by manufacturer name
- Visualize all data from the cars
- Even though there are only 5 cars, design it to fit more.

## Things we are looking for
- Best practices
- Visual eye
- Code structure

## How to get started

- Clone this repository
- Client
    - Run: npm install
    - Run: ng serve (start angular app)
- Server
    - Run: npm install
    - Run: npm run start (start node server on 127.0.0.1:5080)

Server API:
- GET: /api/cars
    - Query params:
        - manufacturer (allows you to do a search on car manufacturers)



## When you are finished

- Upload project to your personal GitHub account and send link in an email to your contact person at Plugit
